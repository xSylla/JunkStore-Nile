# Amazon Games on JunkStore
## Setup
### You've to put repo files into the following path: ~/homebrew/data/Junk-Store
### After that, re execute "install dependecies" from JunkStore

## Flatpak branch
### That branch is for who use Steam as flatpak and use the edited files that I made on [JunkStore](https://github.com/xSylla/junkstore) (as it won't work ootb on flatpak Steam)
### In that case, you've to follow the same setup but in that case, you've to manually execute the login.sh for the flatpak variant as for now, I don't have a fix on JunkStore (edited one for flatpak)
